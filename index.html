                <p>Today we had the introduction for FrontEnd Development at Sundsgården. 
                    I am <strong>super excited!</strong> It took a lot less time than anticipated so I had 
                    the chance to call CSN regarding paperwork and catch up on coursework 
                    from Textilhögskolan. 
                    Mom picked up Lo so I had a couple of hours to finish a few quizes and do some 
                    planning. Everything feels better with a plan. 
                </p>
                <p>Had falafels and mashed potatoes for dinner. Surprisingly tasty 
                    combination.

                <p>I had a really long day. Just a really long day. Had the laundry 
                    room booked and it was my turn to drop Lo off at daycare. 
                    Went home and finished a few assignments for the courses at 
                    Textilhögskolan. I dropped Lo at her grandma after daycare 
                    and went to the dentist and had him <del>steal all of my money</del> <ins>fix 
                    my cavaties</ins>. He was very nice and polished of my coffe stains FOC 
                    while waiting for the anesthesia to kick in.
                </p>
                <p>Ate pasta with zucchini, tomates and sallad. Lo only wanted to eat the 
                    tomatoes and parmesan. I couldn't feel half of my mouth so it was a 
                    gamble to try to chew (I'm very brave ok).

                <p>Hardly slept due to a child that did not sleep, so that was ""fun"". Work 
                    today - 8 days in a row then I get a couple of days off. I have less 
                    than 2 weeks left now. I'm gonna miss my colleagues and the chat and 
                    the Fika Fridays. I'm also gonna miss that joke of a program, Amadeus. 
                    I actually feel kinda sad that I don't get a chance to work more 
                    with Amadeus and to properly learn it. But not gonna lie, will not miss the fear of 
                    hitting ER instead of RT. I don't know what they were thinking when 
                    they put the save command next to the retrieve command when nothing is 
                    reversible. There is no <kbd>ctrl+z</kbd> in the flight booking 
                    business. 
                </p>
                <p>Tried to understand Git but I didn't. Gonna have to google Git for 
                    dummies. The video below is an accurate depiction of me following along 
                    in the git tutorials. Made myself a <a href="https://github.com/amelielidaeng" 
                    target="_blank">Github profile</a> and played around with some HTML which was fun!

                <p>Made tacos for dinner. Lo only wanted to eat the tomatoes, corn and 
                    cheese. Zo wanted to eat everything but since she is a dog she was 
                    not allowed.

                <p>Work today as well. Hardly any calls are coming in, so I can study 
                    and write my little journal and try some fun html stuff. Notice my 
                    pretty little font-y things!. Gonna need to write a whole-ass 
                    assignment for Textilhögskolan today so I can cash in a few points. 
                    I am trying very hard to lower my standard a bit, stop being a 
                    perfectionist and just write something - anything. Still waiting for 
                    documentation to arrive so I can convince CSN to give me money again.
                </p>
                <p> I'm trying to learn more about html, reading up on the basics and 
                    bookmarking pages that seem like helpful resources. 
                </p>
                <p>No one told me that 90% of parenting is deciding what everyone in 
                    the family will be eating and then preparing and making it. With 
                    that said, I have no idea what I'm cooking tonight.

                <p>So the kid is sick and the sambo is sick and I am super healthy 
                    and super tired. Sent in assignment 1 to Textilhögskolan last night. Did not 
                    expect CSN to deny my application so I'm really hoping for a 
                    passing grade to make up for points missed. Worst case scenario at the 
                    moment is a couple of months without CSN and that is absolutely doable! Obviously 
                    I'm hoping they'll accept my appeal, but you never know. 
                </p>
                <p>But let's skip to the good part: coding is fun! I've spent all my free 
                    time googling and watching youtube videos about git and html. I am kind 
                    of understanding git and I managed to do the inital commit, and the project
                    is on github now. Need to add the changes I am making right now (that is, 
                    just me rambling on about irrelevant stuff).

                <p>It's been a long week and it is not over yet. A few hours of work left. 
                    The rest of the family is still sick. Sent in assignment 2 for circular 
                    fashion so now I'm all done with that course. I have 2 days off 
                    from work next week (my very last days off - okay, I'm feeling a bit 
                    sentimental about leaving this crap job) and should have time to hand 
                    in the final report in Innovative textiles so I can focus 100% on 
                    becoming a front end developer (AAAHH!!). I am really, REALLY excited about all 
                    of the learning over the next few months and - hopefully - starting 
                    a new career! I'm really happy about how supportive my brother has been regarding 
                    my career change! Since he knows a bunch of these stuff, it feels nice to know that
                    he thinks I can do it to.

                <p>I got an error when saving my changes due to index.html was a read 
                    only file. Got the option to overwrite so I did. I am now wondering if 
                    it had something to do with git. Gonna go look in to that now. 
                    <br> Update: yeah, it probably was git related since I was changing the 
                    master. I think. Created a couple of branches and did a pull request 
                    and now I'm feeling like yeeeees I got this, but at the same time I'm 
                    feeling like the meme with the dog working on his computer.

                <p>I did absolutely nothing of value on Sunday, which I suppose was extremely
                    valuable for my general well-being. I think I took three calls during my shift
                    today and the rest of the time was spent chatting with my colleagues and watching
                    parks and recreation.

                <p> We made tomatoes, zucchini and beans in the oven, mashed it with the potato masher, 
                    added oatly iMat and a ton - a literal ton - of parmesan. Served with pasta.

                    with little links to my entries. Gonna see if I can sort that out even though we 
                    haven't covered it yet. The list part should be fine, but I want a lil box on the

                <p>So it's pink alright! And also a pinker header and footer. What I can't do 
                    is to get the sidebar working like I want. Well, the sidebar is a lil sidebar, but 
                    it covers the text in the body/main. Will ask my teacher what I'm getting wrong 
                    when I send in the assignment. Will take it out from my code since it is messing 
                    things up. I'll try and let it go for now and instead focus on adding links to my sidenav

                    finish the assignment in Innovative Textiles over my "weekend". I picked up the
                    documentation that CSN has asked for and will send it tomorrow. Fingers crossed

                    better notes - I love studying. Tomorrow evening I'm going to try to make a box or 
                    two. Maybe I can get the fixed footer to work like I wanted! Also on my list is to add 
                    paragraphs to my article and add paddings and margins. Remove all of the BRs. On Friday 
                    I'll start a new project with pictures of my dog. Just a website dedicated to my dog. It's

                    I wrote about compostable socks. That was my innovative idea. Make socks from corn that you can 
                    put in the compost bin. I just need to send the papers to CSN and then I'm done everything

                    not doing what I want. I can't get the other content to line up - it just 
                    ends up underneath. I'm gonna let it go for a bit and see if I can work on 
                    the fixed footer instead.

                <p>I tried the color palette and gradient generators and changed the colors up
                    a bit. Gonna add a few classes so I can get diffent articles in different
                    colors. Update: Went a bit bananas with the colors but I like it. Also 
                    fixed the issues with the links in the menu and thanks to my classmates in the 
                    discord chat I sorted out the fixed sidebar. Still on the todos is read and 
                    fix the footer.

                    are added to Ladok. One assignment from Cirkulär Textil is not graded yet but 
                    should not be an issue. Still no reply from CSN regarding my appeal but fingers 
                    are crossed and thumbs are held.

                 way to get some work experience and deeper knowledge. Before starting this course I applied 
                 for a bootcamp position at Stratiteq but didn't get it. I'll contact them again in a 
                 couple of months when I've got a portfolio and a few projects to point to. 
                </p>
                <p>I've been trying to find out if there are any groups or networks of women in tech 
                 or women in programming around Helsingborg.
