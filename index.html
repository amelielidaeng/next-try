        <article>Today we had the introduction for FrontEnd Development at Sundsgården. 
            I am <strong>super excited!</strong> It took a lot less time than anticipated so I had 
            the chance to call CSN regarding paperwork and catch up on coursework 
            from Textilhögskolan. 
            Mom picked up Lo so I had a couple of hours to finish a few quizes and do some 
            planning. Everything feels better with a plan. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Had falafels and mashed potatoes for dinner. Surprisingly tasty 
            combination.</article>

        <h4 class="date">tuesday 18jan22</h4>
        <article>I had a really long day. Just a really long day. Had the laundry 
            room booked and it was my turn to drop Lo off at daycare. 
            Went home and finished a few assignments for the courses at 
            Textilhögskolan. I dropped Lo at her grandma after daycare 
            and went to the dentist and had him <del>steal all of my money</del> <ins>fix 
            my cavaties</ins>. He was very nice and polished of my coffee stains FOC 
            while waiting for the anesthesia to kick in.
            <br>
            <br>
            Ate pasta with zucchini, tomates and sallad. Lo only wanted to eat the 
            tomatoes and parmesan. I couldn't feel half of my mouth so it was a 
            gamble to try to chew (I'm very brave ok).

        <h4 class="date">wednesday 19jan22</h4>
        <article>Hardly slept due to a child that did not sleep, so that was ""fun"". Work 
            today - 8 days in a row then I get a couple of days off. I have less 
            than 2 weeks left now. I'm gonna miss my colleagues and the chat and 
            the Fika Fridays. I'm also gonna miss that joke of a program, Amadeus. 
            I actually feel kinda sad that I don't get a chance to work more 
            with Amadeus and to properly learn it. But not gonna lie, will not miss the fear of 
            hitting ER instead of RT. I don't know what they were thinking when 
            they put the save command next to the retrieve command when nothing is 
            reversible. There is no <kbd>ctrl+z</kbd> in the flight booking 
            business. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Tried to understand Git but I didn't. Gonna have to google Git for 
            dummies. The video below is an accurate depiction of me following along 
            in the git tutorials. Made myself a <a href="https://github.com/amelielidaeng" 
            target="_blank">Github profile</a> and played around with some HTML which was fun!

            <br>
            Made tacos for dinner. Lo only wanted to eat the tomatoes, corn and 
            cheese. Zo wanted to eat everything but since she is a dog she was 
            not allowed.

        <article>Work today as well. Hardly any calls are coming in, so I can study 
            and write my little journal and try some fun html stuff. Notice my 
            pretty little font-y things!. Gonna need to write a whole-ass 
            assignment for Textilhögskolan today so I can cash in a few points. 
            I am trying very hard to lower my standard a bit, stop being a 
            perfectionist and just write something - anything. Still waiting for 
            documentation to arrive so I can convince CSN to give me money again.
            <br>
            <br>
            I'm trying to learn more about html, reading up on the basics and 
            bookmarking pages that seem like helpful resources. 
            <br>
            <br>
            No one told me that 90% of parenting is deciding what everyone in 
            the family will be eating and then preparing and making it. With 
            that said, I have no idea what I'm cooking tonight.

        <article>So the kid is sick and the sambo is sick and I am super healthy 
            and super tired. Sent in assignment 1 to Textilhögskolan last night. Did not 
            expect CSN to deny my application so I'm really hoping for a 
            passing grade to make up for points missed. Worst case scenario at the 
            moment is a couple of months without CSN and that is absolutely doable! Obviously 
            I'm hoping they'll accept my appeal, but you never know. 
            <br> 
            <br>
            But let's skip to the good part: coding is fun! I've spent all my free 
            time googling and watching youtube videos about git and html. I am kind 
            of understanding git and I managed to do the inital commit, and the project
            is on github now. Need to add the changes I am making right now (that is, 
            just me rambling on about irrelevant stuff).

            Rak thai has closed so I bought us falafels. It's been a falafelly week.

        <article>It's been a long week and it is not over yet. A few hours of work left. 
            The rest of the family is still sick. Sent in assignment 2 for circular 
            fashion so now I'm all done with that course. I have 2 days off 
            from work next week (my very last days off - okay, I'm feeling a bit 
            sentimental about leaving this crap job) and should have time to hand 
            in the final report in Innovative textiles so I can focus 100% on 
            becoming a front end developer (AAAHH!!). I am really, REALLY excited about all 
            of the learning over the next few months and - hopefully - starting 
            a new career! I'm really happy about how supportive my brother has been regarding 
            my career change! Since he knows a bunch of these stuff, it feels nice to know that
            he thinks I can do it to.

            I got an error when saving my changes due to index.html was a read 
            only file. Got the option to overwrite so I did. I am now wondering if 
            it had something to do with git. Gonna go look in to that now. 
            <br> Update: yeah, it probably was git related since I was changing the 
            master. I think. Created a couple of branches and did a pull request 
            and now I'm feeling like yeeeees I got this, but at the same time I'm 
            feeling like the meme with the dog working on his computer.

        <article>I did absolutely nothing of value on Sunday, which I suppose was extremely
            valuable for my general well-being. I think I took three calls during my shift
            today and the rest of the time was spent chatting with my colleagues and watching
            parks and recreation. 
            <br>
            <br>
            We made tomatoes, zucchini and beans in the oven, mashed it with the potato masher, 
            added oatly iMat and a ton - a literal ton - of parmesan. Served with pasta.

        <article>We got the new assignments and videos about CSS today! I am excited about colors!
            I'm just gonna do a bunch of pink I think. I wanna try and do a sidebar of somekind 
            with little links to my entries. Gonna see if I can sort that out even though we 
            haven't covered it yet. The list part should be fine, but I want a lil box on the 
            right. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Potatoes and beet sallad was on the menu. Get paid tomorrow so I splurged on quorn filets
            and lösgodis. That was a really good idea, a big thank you to me.

        <h4 class="date">tuesday 25jan22</h4>
        <article>So it's pink alright! And also a pinker header and footer. What I can't do 
            is to get the sidebar working like I want. Well, the sidebar is a lil sidebar, but 
            it covers the text in the body/main. Will ask my teacher what I'm getting wrong 
            when I send in the assignment. Will take it out from my code since it is messing 
            things up. I'll try and let it go for now and instead focus on adding links to my sidenav 
            (but knowing myself I'll probably be back at it tonight). 
            <br>
            <br>
            What I'm gonna eat tonight? Good question. I would like to just have a lösgodis dinner
            but I have to be responsible and feed my child actual food.
